# Financial Calculator for XYZ Bank
## Aim
In this project I build an interest calculator for a small financial company 'XYZ'. The calculator allows it's users to calculate the final amount, while making an investment or  taking a housing loan.  The user can choose the calculator they want at the initial stage. At the next stages the user has to input the interest rate and the period, based on which the total is calculated

## Objective
This project was made as part of practising the use of variables and control structures in python.

## IDE and Packages
The project was made in VS code. math is the only library needed for this project.

## Formulas used
### Simple interest : *A=P(1+ r x t)*
### Compund interest: *A= P(1+r)^t*
where, 
A= total amount once the interest has been applied
t= number of years the money is being invested
r= interest rate divided by 100
P= amount the user deposits


### Repayment : *ixP/(1-(1+i)^-n*
where,
P= present value of the house
i= monthly interest rate
n= time period over which the bond will be applied

## Note: Python equilalent of these equations are used in the project
